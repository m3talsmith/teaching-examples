Teaching Examples
=================

A collection of programming scenarios to learn from.

Synopsis
-------

As I've been coding through the years I've noticed the same repeating questions from new and old coders. There are specific questions and a lack of understanding of key concepts that span programming languages, education, or experience levels. I'm writing these examples as a way to express these concepts and answer some of the questions. Perhaps other's can learn from them. I hope so.

I'm approaching this from a concept basis. I hold that most concepts overlap languages, and with that in mind, I will be writing the examples in multiple languages. I'll naturally start from the ones I love working in, but eventually I hope to circle back around and fill the gaps with other practical languages. I'd be glad to see other developers filling in the gaps with their preferred langauges. Contributions are very welcome!
